# Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List

## Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.

The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ 

denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.

For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

### Example 1:

Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]

Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]


### Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [1,2,4]

## Example 3:

Input: head = [2,1]

Output: [2]
